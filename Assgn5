Cluster and Hadoop Cluster
Group of simimlar things positioned close to each other is known as a cluster
On the other hand,hadoop cluster is a specail type of computational cluster specifically designed for storing and also 
analysing huge amounts of data.
But here the data are unstructured.
It boosts the speed of data analysis aplications.
But they are highly resistant to failure as each piece of the data is carried into other cluster nodes


Rack and explain the rack arrangement in a hadoop cluster
The Hadoop cluster of more than 30-40 nodes are configured into multiple racks.
The communication between two data nodes of the same rack is more efficient than that betwwn two nodes of differerent racks.
The rack arrangement is depicted in the attached file.
